## Experience and Knowledge
 
### Projects 


I'm currently working with BendJS to help redesign their website.
- [The BendJS Website](https://github.com/BendJS/simple-website/tree/nextjs)
- Established goals for the project.
- Created a mockup.
- Implemented mockup in react.
- Researched different headless CMS.
- Migrated redesign in React to Next.js.
- Embedded Sanity Studio in Next.js.
- Worked with multiple branches in git, performed and fixed merge conflicts.
- Fixed Netlify build errors.

I've built a couple MERN stack applications written with Typescript.

- [Weather-App](https://github.com/nslee333/Weather-App)
  - Weather App:
    - Consuming and exposing API data.
    - Fetching current, hourly, daily forecasts.
    - Multiple cities saved feature with localStorage.
    - Cooldown feature that after an API request, caches the data on the backend, and serves the cached copy to the client if the API has been requested recently to avoid excessive API requests.
- [Task-App](https://github.com/nslee333/Task-App)
  - A very basic todo app.
    - Add, remove todo items in react frontend.
